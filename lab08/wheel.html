	<h2>Wheel Style </h2>
	<p>The earliest Tomica cars had one-piece chrome-plated wheels. Starting in 1971, models were produced with two-piece wheels of various styles, with the one-piece chrome-plated wheels being phased out in 1972. </p>
	<p>The two-piece wheels were used until 1977, while newer one-piece wheels of various styles have been adopted since 1976, and are still used today.</p>
	<p>The most common design is a five-spoke chrome on black plastic form that appears to have five studs around the edge of the wheel. This design has even been continued with the newer vehicles made in Vietnam. Another common style is a black plastic wheel with a single chrome ring and no other outstanding detail. Later Tomicas have a slightly redesigned wheel design, with the 'studs' slightly smaller. Some SUVs have a 4-spoke chrome with grooves on the outside.</p>
