	<p>Tomica is the line of die-cast toy vehicles produced since 1970 by Takara Tomy Co. of Japan. Ostensibly, Tomica diecast were an outgrowth of Tomica World, an autonomous toy line of motorized train accessories that Tomy had created based on Plarail and produced since 1959. Similar in concept, Tomica can be thought of as the Matchbox of Japan - but focuses mainly on Japanese brands.</p>
	<p>In 1988, Tomy combined its foreign models into the domestic series. Most of the first 40 models from the foreign series were added to the 80 domestic models. Those foreign models that got transferred were assigned a number that was its F series number plus 80. A handful of these foreign models were discontinued after a few months appearance under the new line. Overall about half of them had been discontinued after two years.</p>
	<p>From 2001 to 2013, Tomy produced the TL series targeted for the collector. These models are made with higher details, and one of their biggest features is realistic-looking wheels with rubberized plastic tires. Although many of them are based on existing or discontinued regular Tomica models, some are new castings made exclusively for the TL line, namely, Nissan Skyline GTB, Toyoda AA, and new MINI Cooper. In the case of the new MINI Cooper, the model was first released for the TL series in 2004 but in 2006 included in the regular line as no. 43. Model numbers started at 0001. Each model is produced for a limited period of time, so models with smaller numbers are discontinued while new models with higher numbers continue to appear. These models are packaged in open cardboard boxes surrounded on four sides with a transparent plastic sleeve.    </p>

	<h2>Long Tomica</h2>
	<p>Longer buses and semi-trailer trucks were models not suitable for the regular small boxes, so Tomy also started the "Long Tomica" series in 1977. Castings such as trucks, articulated buses or Shinkansen trains were produced as single models until 1993. However, some of these long models still appeared in gift sets after 1993, such as the JAL Airport Vehicles Set. Many of these were specifically for foreign markets, like the Trathen's Skyliner bus which made the Plymouth to London trek in the U.K. . Beginning in 2009, Tomy produces newer versions of "Long Tomica", such as the newest Shinkansen trains or large semi trailer trucks, as part of the regular series under model numbers 121 to 140.</p>	

	<h2>Wheel Style </h2>
	<p>The earliest Tomica cars had one-piece chrome-plated wheels. Starting in 1971, models were produced with two-piece wheels of various styles, with the one-piece chrome-plated wheels being phased out in 1972. </p>
	<p>The two-piece wheels were used until 1977, while newer one-piece wheels of various styles have been adopted since 1976, and are still used today.</p>
	<p>The most common design is a five-spoke chrome on black plastic form that appears to have five studs around the edge of the wheel. This design has even been continued with the newer vehicles made in Vietnam. Another common style is a black plastic wheel with a single chrome ring and no other outstanding detail. Later Tomicas have a slightly redesigned wheel design, with the 'studs' slightly smaller. Some SUVs have a 4-spoke chrome with grooves on the outside.</p>

	<p>In the early years, Tomy produced cars with famous characters sitting on them, using the same castings from the regular Tomica line. The first of such was the Snoopy character cars from the 1970s. Tomy did not market and distribute these cars. Rather, they produced these for Aviva, who sold the toy under the Aviva brand name. In the early 1980's Tomy produced models with Muppet characters. Also in the 1980's, Tomy started producing vehicles with Disney characters under the Putica Disney series name. This popular series was made until the late 1990's and was also re-issued in the original style boxes sometime during the 2000's.   </p>
	<p>Circa 1990s, when Tomy created a cartoon called "Tomica Rescue", it started another series using regular Tomica models and some Matchbox models with some add-ons such as cannons, armors and water hoses. In 1996, a series specially designed for the Japanese comic or cartoon "Bakuso Kyodai Let's & Go?!!"was initiated. Then came the "Mach Go Go Go" series in 1998. In 2002 a series called Magnum Rescue was launched, and designed very much like today's Hyper Rescue and Hyper Blue Police. Unfortunately, due to safety issues, the Magnum Rescue Police Cruiser was recalled soon after its release.   </p>
	<p>In 2005, to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the renowned Thomas and Friends, Tomy started a Thomas the Tank Engine series. In recent years, Tomy has greatly expanded their specialized character Tomica series. Offerings include "Hyper Rescue", "Hyper Blue Police", the Cars series, Pokemon, Ridge Racer, the Disney Motors series, and racing anime and manga, such as Initial D and Circuit no okami. </p>

	<h2>Special, Promotional and Event models </h2>
	<p>Tomica has produced a number of special models over the years. These are unique models that are not found in the regular line or the Limited Series. There are four types of special model. A totally new casting. All of these had been produced under the contract of another model company or another business. Their common fate is that Tomy eventually issues them as regular models. Examples include:</p>

	<ul class="cars">
  		<li>Nissan Skyline GT-R R33 Racing Type</li>
  		<li>Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IV</li>
  		<li>Mitsubishi New Canter Panel Truck </li>
		<li>Subaru Legacy Touring Wagon </li>
		<li>Hummer H2</li>
		<li>Nissan Laurel</li>
		<li>Isuzu Giga</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Also, in 2004, no. 121 was available for a limited period from Mitsuoka Motors. This was a 1/1 scale electric single seater vehicle which featured a retro Citroen H Van front end and side panels. See also:</p>
