	<h2>Long Tomica</h2>
	<p>Longer buses and semi-trailer trucks were models not suitable for the regular small boxes, so Tomy also started the "Long Tomica" series in 1977. Castings such as trucks, articulated buses or Shinkansen trains were produced as single models until 1993. However, some of these long models still appeared in gift sets after 1993, such as the JAL Airport Vehicles Set. Many of these were specifically for foreign markets, like the Trathen's Skyliner bus which made the Plymouth to London trek in the U.K. . Beginning in 2009, Tomy produces newer versions of "Long Tomica", such as the newest Shinkansen trains or large semi trailer trucks, as part of the regular series under model numbers 121 to 140.</p>
