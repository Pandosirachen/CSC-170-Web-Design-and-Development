	<p>In the early years, Tomy produced cars with famous characters sitting on them, using the same castings from the regular Tomica line. The first of such was the Snoopy character cars from the 1970s. Tomy did not market and distribute these cars. Rather, they produced these for Aviva, who sold the toy under the Aviva brand name. In the early 1980's Tomy produced models with Muppet characters. Also in the 1980's, Tomy started producing vehicles with Disney characters under the Putica Disney series name. This popular series was made until the late 1990's and was also re-issued in the original style boxes sometime during the 2000's.   </p>
	<p>Circa 1990s, when Tomy created a cartoon called "Tomica Rescue", it started another series using regular Tomica models and some Matchbox models with some add-ons such as cannons, armors and water hoses. In 1996, a series specially designed for the Japanese comic or cartoon "Bakuso Kyodai Let's & Go?!!"was initiated. Then came the "Mach Go Go Go" series in 1998. In 2002 a series called Magnum Rescue was launched, and designed very much like today's Hyper Rescue and Hyper Blue Police. Unfortunately, due to safety issues, the Magnum Rescue Police Cruiser was recalled soon after its release.   </p>

	<h2>Special, Promotional and Event models </h2>
	<p>Tomica has produced a number of special models over the years. These are unique models that are not found in the regular line or the Limited Series. There are four types of special model. A totally new casting. All of these had been produced under the contract of another model company or another business. Their common fate is that Tomy eventually issues them as regular models. Examples include:</p>

	<ul class="cars">
  		<li>Nissan Skyline GT-R R33 Racing Type</li>
  		<li>Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IV</li>
  		<li>Mitsubishi New Canter Panel Truck </li>
		<li>Subaru Legacy Touring Wagon </li>
		<li>Hummer H2</li>
		<li>Nissan Laurel</li>
		<li>Isuzu Giga</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In 2005, to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the renowned Thomas and Friends, Tomy started a Thomas the Tank Engine series. In recent years, Tomy has greatly expanded their specialized character Tomica series. Offerings include "Hyper Rescue", "Hyper Blue Police", the Cars series, Pokemon, Ridge Racer, the Disney Motors series, and racing anime and manga, such as Initial D and Circuit no okami. </p>
